I have officially migrated this blog over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com). This is very exciting for me as it provides a more flexible platform for both UI and content modification. After having tried Tumblr for several months, I found it lacking as a blogging software as a whole. I'll go into more detail below.

# A little background

As many of you may know, I started this blog back in April 2014. It was yet another self-maintained blog powered by [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). Well, as it turns out, I didn't want to worry too much about the continued maintenance of my blog's software. Seeing how [Wordpress has a new vulnerability every day](https://wpvulndb.com/), it becomes a full-time job simply to ensure your blog software is up-to-date; forget about writing the content for it.

Skip ahead about 10 months. At present, I currently work for the company who owns Tumblr ([maybe you've even heard of them](https://yahoo.com)) and they were encouraging employees to get involved with Tumblr. Consequently, I happily migrated (via the beloved copy-paste method) my Wordpress blog into my new Tumblr. I updated an A record on my domain and voila, new blog hosted on Tumblr.

# Why move from Tumblr?

After experimenting with Tumblr starting in January 2015, I feel I have given it a fair chance. Unfortunately, I encountered several problems related to running a **software engineering**-oriented blog.

  1. **Editing tools not made for code.** The editing tools clearly were not made with the intent for people to share code. To update my blog with new content was always an arduous process making sure I properly replaced <, >, and any other commonly used characters that they sanitized away.
  1. **Difficulty reaching target audience.** As I said, I've been on Tumblr for the better part of the last year. As it seems, the audience I'm looking to target is not exactly there. I receive far better response on Twitter than I have from posting on Tumblr-- this says a lot. I haven't actively used my Twitter account until this past Friday. That said, I personally have followed some blogs which I find do provide interesting (often non-technology related) content.
  1. **No backup system.** Tumblr has no backup system. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't feel comfortable not being able to easily generate backups of my own content. There are services like [revert.io](http://revert.io) but they require special invites for Tumblr access. This became a particular pain point when I migrated to GH pages. In fact, I had to roll my own tool to grab my content and-- with some hand curation-- made code blocks, etc. conform to the new way of doing things here. To be honest, this is the *single largest reason* I have moved away from Tumblr.

While Tumblr didn't exactly work for my blog, I would never discount it as a valuable service. As I mentioned earlier, I found some interesting bits of information on the site myself and it seems some blogs have found great success there. As of now, however, I could not seem to generate significant hype there which compels me to use it for more than a social media platform. This is not necessarily to the fault of Tumblr (read: I really should be promoting better), but it does not provide me any additional incentive to remain on the platform in light of the problems I've encountered for my purposes.

# Should I stay away from Tumblr?

No. I highly recommend Tumblr, actually. I find it to be a more pleasant experience than Facebook overall as a social network.

# Conclusion

As I've said before, pick the right tool for the job; it's as simple as that. While I believe Tumblr has its merits, I find that GitHub pages will better serve my blogging and work here.
