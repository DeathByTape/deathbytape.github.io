<p>First post.</p><p>Great, now that I&rsquo;ve gotten that out of my system, I&rsquo;ll explain a little bit about who I am and why I am here. My name is Dennis McWherter; I am software engineer for Yahoo! I work primarily on backend systems nowadays, but in previous lives I have worked on both embedded systems and web frontends. I really enjoy technology and taking the time to determine the <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-two-types-of-programmers/" target="_blank">right tool for the job</a>Â (though I don&rsquo;t believe life is as cut and dry as it sounds there).</p>
<p>Now that you know a little more about me, on to why I&rsquo;m here: I am simply excited about what I do and I want to share it with everyone I can. I work for a great company doing interesting and challenging work everyday while learning and developing new skills and paradigms which will be valuable to everyone. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the years from &ldquo;&lt;insert name here&gt;&rsquo;s random blog,&rdquo; so I figured that it&rsquo;s my turn to return the favor.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll keep the first one short and sweet since it&rsquo;s mostly background about me (and that&rsquo;s not nearly as interesting). Anyway, I plan on keeping this thing up-to-date, so be sure to follow for new and interesting posts!</p>
