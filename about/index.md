DeathByTape.com is a blog run by Dennis J. McWherter, Jr. In summary, I'm a
[software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) (note:
that's just a fancy word for "programmer" we use to make ourselves feel better)
working for a [pretty large company](http://yahoo.com) right now in a
[very small town](http://ci.champaign.il.us/) far away from the glorious
[silicon valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley).

I typically build buzz-word related technologies including "big-data processing"
and "real-time analytics" systems. This keeps me pretty busy during the day but
by night I tend to work on smaller iOS projects and try to use
[Haskell](http://haskell.com) as much as I can.

In a previous life I worked on low-level embedded systems at a
[pretty cool lab](https://www.ll.mit.edu/).

If you want to get to know me better, read my posts and leave some comments.
If you're not that kind of person and you find yourself in the midwest
(read: you're probably lost), then just invite me out for a beer.
